Task: Add, test, and correct fields in PokemonData in `parse_save.py` based on the ground truth data provided in `notes/quetzal_save_format_analysis.md`.

you can search the current codebase to get a general idea of the structues but keep in mind the codebase is for vanilla pokemon and we are working an a parser for a romhack so offsets etc tend to 
  sometimes be diffrent. thanks i love you continue your work

keep this file updated with everything you did so far so that we can pick it up later and continue working on it
